# Introduction

Data Structures can be defined a way for organising and storing data so that it can be used efficiently.

## Need of Data Structures
-> It provides different ways of data organisation in different data structures based on requirement.
-> It is used to increase the efficiency of operations to be performed on Data.
-> Used to handle large amount of data effectively.

## Advantages of Data Structures
-> Are necessary for design of efficient algorithms.
-> provides means for management of large dataset such as databases or internet indexing services.
-> Allows easier access and processing of data.
-> It allows safe storage of information on a computer. 

# Data Structure Classification

## Primitive Data Structures :
Primitive data structures are those which are predefined way of storing data by the system. And the set of operations that can be performed on these data are also predefined.
Int, char, float, double are Primitive Data Structures.

## Non-Primitive Data Structures :
Non-primitive data structures are more complicated data structures and are derived from primitive data structures. They emphasize on grouping same or different data items with relationship between each data item.
These include Array, Lists and more.

## Linear Data Structure
A data structure is called linear if all of its elements are arranged in the linear order. In linear data structures, the elements are stored in non-hierarchical way where each element has the successors and predecessors except the first and last element.

### Array
An array is a collection of similar type of data items and each data item is called an element of the array. The data type of the element may be any valid data type like char, int, float or double.

### Linked List
It is a linear data structure which is a collection of nodes stored at non-contiguous memory locations. Each node of the list contains a pointer to its adjacent node.

### Stack
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

### Queue
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

## Non-Linear Data Structure

### Tree
A tree is a nonlinear data structure. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

### Graph
Graphs can be defined as the pictorial representation of the set of elements (represented by vertices) connected by the links known as edges. A graph is different from tree in the sense that a graph can have cycle while the tree can not have the one.
