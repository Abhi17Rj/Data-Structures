# Array

A static array container containing n elements indexable from the range [0, n-1] in contiguous memory.

## Static Array 
Static arrays store their values on the stack, and their size must be known at compile time.

## Dynamic Array
Dynamic arrays are those arrays which are allocated memory at the run time with the help of heap.Thus Dynamic array can change its size during run time.

## When and where is Static Array used.
1. Storing and Accessing sequential data.

2. Temporarily storing objects.

3. Lookup tables and Inverse Lookup tables.

4. Used in Dynamic Programming to cache answers to subproblems.
