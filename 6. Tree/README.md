# TREE

A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is an Undirected graph which follows any of the following properties :

-> An acyclic connected Graph. (No cycles are present)

-> graph has **N** nodes and **N-1** edges.

-> in which any two **Vertices** are connected by one path.


## Why Tree Data Structure ?
-> Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.

-> It offers an efficient search and insertion procedure.

-> The trees are flexible. This allows subtrees to be relocated with minimal effort.


## Basic Tree Terminologies :

**Node :** A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to its child nodes.

**Edge :** It is the link between any two nodes.

**Root Node :** The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In other words, the root node is the one which doesn't have any parent.

**Leaf Node :** The node of tree, which doesn't have any child node, is called leaf node. Leaf node is the bottom most node of the tree.

**Degree :** Degree of a node is equal to number of children, a node have.

**Subtree :** Subtree represents the descendants of a node. Also known as **_Forest_**.

**Height of a Tree :** The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node.
